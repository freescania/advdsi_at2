# Beer Reviews Project

This project was designed to take a few key features from a beer 
styles data set and then build a model that would take those inputs
and then predict the given beer style. It takes four inputs (review_aroma, 
review_appearance, review_palate, review_taste) and each one must 
be given an integer score from 0-5 and then it will predict the beer.
